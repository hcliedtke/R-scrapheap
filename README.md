# [My R scrapheap](https://hcliedtke.github.io/R-scrapheap/)

This is a front page for the various different R code and projects I am currently developing/maintaining.
It also includes bits of code that I have found use for more than once, and thought others might too.

##### *That ugly chunk of code you really should delete, but can't bring yourself to do it, so you 'comment' it out instead:*
