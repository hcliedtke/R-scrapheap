# My R scrapheap

Here are bits of code that I have found use for more than once, and thought others might too.

### that ugly chunk of code you comment out instead of delete:
<div class="tenor-gif-embed" data-postid="9016684" data-share-method="host" data-width="100%" data-aspect-ratio="1.754901960784314"><a href="https://tenor.com/view/steveirwin-crocodilehunter-poo-savingitforlater-missyoudude-gif-9016684">Steveirwin Crocodilehunter GIF</a> from <a href="https://tenor.com/search/steveirwin-gifs">Steveirwin GIFs</a></div><script type="text/javascript" async src="https://tenor.com/embed.js"></script>




All code will be uploaded as a github-pages style [website](https://hcliedtke.github.io/code-bits/):
