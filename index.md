I use R on a daily basis and fairly regularly I run into re-occuring problems. After years of frantically searching through various scripts to see how I solved it last time, I have decided to compile (sometimes) useful bits of code that I might need again. Some of these have been developed into full-fletched R packages or Shiny Apps. Below some of these projects.

Who knows... maybe they are useful for other people too!

 
## Phylogenetics and Systematics

* Check out [AmphiNom](https://github.com/hcliedtke/AmphiNom), an R package for working with the Amphibian Species of the World database for amphibian systematics. This [example](https://hcliedtke.github.io/R-scrapheap/amphinom_example.html) or [this one](https://hcliedtke.github.io/R-scrapheap/amphinom_tutorial.html) might help.  
* I am currently developing [BayesTrace](https://github.com/hcliedtke/bayestrace), a shiny application that generates a nice dashboard-like report for BayesTraits analyses.
* Performing [trait evolution model testing using mvMORPH](./mvMORPH.html)  

## Conservation

* Knowning when a species is just really good at hidding or has in all likelyhood gone extinct is no easy task. [This shiny app](https://github.com/hcliedtke/extinct) should help with that!

## Transcriptomics

* I teach a short crash courses on how to analyse RNAseq data for differential gene expression analyses, for bioinformatics students at the Master's level. Check out the course website with code [here](https://hcliedtke.github.io/ADDA_taller2/)
